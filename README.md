- Hi, I‚Äôm @Tudills and I am just going to use Githubs standard set up for right now. 
- I‚Äôm interested in technology as a whole. I like science fiction, tinkering, and learning. I made this Github for really 2 purposes, to learn and to document for posterity.
- I‚Äôm currently learning Proxmox, Python, C++, Bash, HTB, THM, Vulnhub... books. 
- I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I typically like to do things on my own.
- How to reach me: I'd rather you didn't if I were honest.
- Fun fact: Gavrilo Princip, The assasin of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand actually conspired with a bunch of people that he worked with in Bosnia,
  after one of the conspirators failed, Gavrilo started to walk home and stopped to get a sandwich.
  After he exited the sandwich store. He turned the corner and encountered the Arch Duke and his Wife.
  according to my research, the kind of sandwich he had when he assasinated the Arch Duke is unknown. 

My To Do List
- Portswiggers web security academy
- tryhackme
- picoCTF

## üõ°Ô∏è 1. Core Security Foundations (Free + Legit)

These give you practical security knowledge, look solid in a GitHub README or PDF r√©sum√©, and cost you **nothing**.

| Cert | Why It Matters | Time to Complete |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Fortinet NSE 1‚Äì3** | Basic network + security fundamentals. Easy wins. | 2‚Äì4 hrs per level |
| **Cisco CyberOps Associate (Skills for All)** | Covers real SOC fundamentals. Browser-based. | ~10 hrs |
| **TryHackMe: PreSecurity** | Teaches Linux, networking, basic security skills. | ~10‚Äì15 hrs |
| **TryHackMe: Jr. Pen Tester** | Intro to enumeration, privilege escalation, real hands-on practice. | ~20‚Äì40 hrs |
| **Microsoft SC-900 (via free Virtual Training Day)** | Cloud identity, compliance, and security basics. Good signal. | 1-day course + short exam |

---

## üß™ 2. Offensive Security & Hands-On Training

Start applying skills in a lab. These help you learn red teaming, CTF flow, and hacker mindset.

| Badge/Platform | Focus | Value |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| **OffSec Free Learning Paths** | Linux, Windows, Buffer Overflows, etc. | Real foundational badges from the OSCP folks |
| **Hack The Box Profile** | Hands-on enumeration + exploitation | Build stats, upload writeups, track growth |
| **Personal GitHub Writeups** | TryHackMe, HTB, scripting projects | Shows real work. No need for flashy UI ‚Äî clear, honest README is enough. |

---

## üì¶ 3. Optional: Coursera Certs (Free via Aid or Trial)

These are well-structured certs, but *not required* unless you want to pad your r√©sum√©. Use financial aid or trial periods to avoid fees.

| Cert | Description | Worth It If... |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **IBM Cybersecurity Analyst** | Intro to SIEMs, SOC work, forensics | You want blue team foundations |
| **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** | Linux, Python, threat detection | You want generalist coverage and modern tools |
| **Google IT Support** | Sysadmin, networking, OS basics | You're pivoting from a non-IT background |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Practice Environment You Already Have

‚úÖ **Proxmox** ‚Äî Snapshots, VLANs, multiple VMs  
‚úÖ **Kali + Metasploitable** ‚Äî Full attack surface  
‚úÖ **Docker** ‚Äî Automation + isolation  
‚úÖ **Hak5 Gear + Flipper Zero** ‚Äî Hardware edge  
‚úÖ **Bash / Python scripting** ‚Äî Real skill in toolmaking

## üß† Tips

- Frame projects around **problem-solving**, not piracy (e.g., ‚Äúmedia automation,‚Äù not ‚Äúripping DVDs‚Äù).
- GitHub = your r√©sum√©. Make it clean, organized, and honest.
- No need to spam certs. Show curiosity, scripting, and persistence.
- You‚Äôre already doing the hard part: learning *because you want to*.
