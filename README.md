- Hi, I’m @Tudills and I am just going to use Githubs standard set up for right now. 
- I’m interested in technology as a whole. I like science fiction, tinkering, and learning. I made this Github for really 2 purposes, to learn and to document for posterity.
- I’m currently learning Proxmox, Python, C++, Bash, HTB, THM, Vulnhub... books. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I typically like to do things on my own.
- How to reach me: I'd rather you didn't if I were honest.
- Fun fact: Gavrilo Princip, The assasin of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand actually conspired with a bunch of people that he worked with in Bosnia,
  after one of the conspirators failed, Gavrilo started to walk home and stopped to get a sandwich.
  After he exited the sandwich store. He turned the corner and encountered the Arch Duke and his Wife.
  according to my research, the kind of sandwich he had when he assasinated the Arch Duke is unknown. 

My To Do List
- Portswiggers web security academy
